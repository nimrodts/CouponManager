# ClipIt

ClipIt is a smart Android application designed to organize, track, and redeem detailed digital coupons and gift cards. Built with privacy and ease of use in use, it offers a complete solution for managing coupon expiry, remaining balances, and redemption history.

## Key Features

### 🏷️ Coupon Management

*   **Organization**: Organize coupons into custom categories with personalized names, colors, and icons.
*   **Smart Search & Filter**: Easily find coupons by search query, category, or sorting by date, name, or value.
*   **Archiving**: Archive used or expired coupons to keep your main dashboard clean without losing data.

### 🧠 AI Integration (Gemini)
*   **Smart Parsing**: Powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash, the app can intelligently parse coupon details (name, code, value, date) from unstructured text or messages.
*   **Customizable**: Configure your own Gemini API key and select preferred models and temperature settings directly in the app.

### ☁️ Cloud & Local Backup
*   **Google Drive Sync**: Seamlessly backup your entire database to Google Drive and restore it on any device.
*   **Manual Export**: Export your database as a portable file for manual backups.

### 📜 History & Time Travel
The app maintains an immutable timeline of every action performed on a coupon, serving as an audit trail and safety net.
*   **Tracked Operations**:
    *   **Creation**: Initial entry.
    *   **Edits**: Changes to name, date, category, etc.
    *   **Usage**: Deductions from balance.
    *   **Status**: Archiving/Unarchiving.
